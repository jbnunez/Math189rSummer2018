Materials for Math 189r - Big Data Analytics

Homeworks will be posted following the end of class each day, and will be due at the start of class the following day.

A sample solution for the written portion of the homework will be posted at noon the day it is due. If the homework is not posted by this time, send me an email and I'll upload it.

I will hold tutoring from 2 pm to 4 pm.  I would recommend attempting the problem before looking at the solution, and, if it is still unclear, coming to tutoring with questions.  I will also be able to help with implementing the coding portions of the homework.
