Materials for Math 189r - Big Data Analytics

Homeworks will be posted following the end of class each day, and will be due at the start of class the following day.  The homework will be posted as a .zip file in the format hwN_starter_files.zip.

A sample solution for the written portion of the homework will be posted at noon the day it is due. If the homework is not posted by this time, send me an email and I'll upload it. The solution will be posted as a .zip file in the format hwN_soln.zip.

I will hold tutoring from 2 pm to 4 pm.  I would recommend attempting the problem before looking at the solution, and, if it is still unclear, coming to tutoring with questions.  I will also be able to help with implementing the coding portions of the homework.

Many of the coding problems use Python packages like numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.  To ensure that these don't cause you any errors, I recommend installing the latest Anaconda distribution of Python.
